Simple Slides v1.0
Written By: Andrew Spittal
Date: May 1st 2012
Description: A simple plugin which ties into a pre-formatted 
DOM with slides, next and previous buttons. This plugin does not add
buttons or slides for you, which gives you full control over how it looks.
The elements can be any class name if you pass in the alternate class names as options.
This plugin currently is a proof of concept and may be extended in the future to:
 - Add buttons automatically if required
 - Allow custom animation to be passed in for changing between slides
 - A way of adding a jump to any slide pager

Requirements:
jQuery 1.6+ (I haven't tested on older versions)

Default Options:
slide: '.slide' - The class name for the div of slide
nextSlide: '.nextSlide' - The class name for the next slide button
previousSlide: '.previousSlide' - The class name for the previous slide button

Assumptions:
Buttons are contained within a 'slide' div

Example Usage:

Just download the js file and include it in your <head> as you do with any javascript.
Make sure you have jQuery1.6+ included as well.

--HTML Example--

<div class="presentation"> 
     <div class="slide">
         <!-- Slide Content -->
         <button class="nextSlide">Next</button>
     </div>
     <div class="slide">
         <!-- Slide Content -->
         <button class="previousSlide">Back</button>
         <button class="nextSlide">Next</button>
     </div>
     <div class="slide">
         <!-- Slide Content -->
         <button class="nextSlide">Next</button>
     </div>
</div>

----------

--jQuery--

$(document).ready( function() {
     $('.presentation').simpleSlides();
});

----------

If you would like to use different names for the slide or buttons,
just pass a parameter when you initialize the plugin.

--jQuery With non-defaults--

$(document).ready( function() {
    $('.presentation').simpleSlides(
        {
            slide: '.mySlideClass',
            previousSlide: '.myPreviousButton',
            nextSlide: '.myNextButton'
        }
    );
});
